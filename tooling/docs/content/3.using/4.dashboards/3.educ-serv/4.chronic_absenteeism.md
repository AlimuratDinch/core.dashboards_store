## Dbt project specification
> Update your `cssxx.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml` file with the following snippet.

```yaml
# cssxx.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml
models:
    tbe:
        marts:
            educ_serv:
                +enabled: True                  
        dashboards:                                   
            chronic_absenteeism:
                +enabled: True
        interfaces:
            gpi:
                +enabled: True
```

# configuration
::alert{type=warning}
The configuration is optional. If you don't provide a configuration, the dashboard will use the default configuration.

##### Overriding the default list of tracked courses
> By default, the dashboard will group up absences using the brackets from `core.dashboards_store/seeds/dashboard/schronic_absenteeism/repartition_brackets.csv`

To get a custom bracketing strategy, you can provide your own implementation of `repartition_brackets`. To do so :
1. Write a CSV file named `repartition_brackets` in the `cssXX.dashboards_store/seeds/dashboards/chronic_absenteeism` folder populated as per the `core.dashboards_store/seeds/dashboards/chronic_absenteism/schema.yml`'s definition.
2. Disable the default seed by using the the following snippet in your `dbt_project.yml` file : 

```yaml
#cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml
seeds:
  store:
    dashboards:
      chronic_absenteeism:
        repartition_brackets:
          +enabled: False
```

__When overriding the repartition bracket, you will need to manualy update the `lorenz` measures from the Dahsboard's concentration page.__
