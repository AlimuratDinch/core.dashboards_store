title: Running the ETL
---

# Introduction
DBT has a built-on orchestrator that allows you to run the ETL. Only the enabled (thoose with the weird `+enabled: true` syntax) models will be run. As all models are disabled by default (the store is lazy), only the models/dashboards manually toogle will be run.

## How to run the store
::alert{type=warning}
All DBT commands schould be called from the `cssXX.dashboards_store` project. 
**BEFORE** calling a DBT command from `cssXX.dashboards_store`, make sure you have activated the Poetry environement by running `poetry shell && poetry install` from `core.dashboards_store`.

::alert{type=info}
To get a complete list of the available options, run `dbt --help`  or, got to the official [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/run)
::

The base command to run and test the store is the following : 

```bash
dbt build
```

If you want to refresh all the seeds, add the `--full-refresh` option

```bash
dbt build --full-refresh
```

If you want to target another environment that the default one, use the `--target` option. you will need this to materialize the store in production.

```bash
dbt build --target prod  
```

if you want to only run the models from a specific mart or for a specific dashboards, use the `--select +tag:<model>` option. 

```bash
dbt build --select +tag:<model>
```
::alert{type=info}
Please consult `core.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yaml` to find the tag of the model you want to run
